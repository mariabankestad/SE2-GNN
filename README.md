# SE2-GNN
This repository contains code accompanying the paper Flexible SE(2) graph neural networks with applications to PDE surrogates. This repo is under construction.


![Rollout results of our SE(2) equivariant GNN and its non-equivariant counterpart.](images/sim1.gif)*The figures show the rollout predictions of our SE(2) equivariant GNN, its non-equivariant counterpart, and the true simulation. The models have seen the first 3 seconds of the simulation.*
