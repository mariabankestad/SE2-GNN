# Flexible SE(2) graph neural networks with applications to PDE surrogates
This repository contains code accompanying the paper _Flexible SE(2) graph neural networks with applications to PDE surrogates_ by Maria BÃ¥nkestad, [Olof Mogren](https://mogren.one/) and [Aleksis Pirinen](https://aleksispi.github.io/), all affiliated with the [_deep learning research group_](https://dl-group.se/) at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden. This repo is under construction.

*The figures show the rollout predictions of our SE(2) equivariant GNN, its non-equivariant counterpart, and the true simulation. The models have only seen the first 3 seconds of the simulation. The bottom simulation is the same as Figure 16 in the article.*
