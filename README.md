# SE2-GNN
This repository contains code accompanying the paper Flexible SE(2) graph neural networks with applications to PDE surrogates.


![Rollout results of our SE(2) equivariant GNN and its non-equivariant counterpart.](images/scatter_sim2.gif)
The figure shows the rollout predictions of our SE(2) equivariant GNN and its non-equivariant counterpart, compared to the true simualtion.
